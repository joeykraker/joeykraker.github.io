    <p class ="info">My name is Joey Kraker. I am 18. Born and raised in Maui, Hawaii. I've been surfing since my dad forced me to get on a board at age 3. I have been hooked since that day. I countine to surf every day, and work at a local surf shop. I have potential to become semi-pro, and just competed in my first semi-pro competition where I landed in 2nd place out of 56 guys in the Kakahuna Classic. I'm striving to make it to the big leagues one day, but I don't try to get too serious about it. Life is meant to be taken easy, and enjoy every moment. You can't get caught up worrying about everything. If it's meant to be, it's meant to be. I capture a lot of my favorite moments, places and people with my photography and videos. All of it is what makes live truly worth living. Every day I wake up seeking the next adventure whether it's surfing a new beach, meeting a new person or traveling to a unique of exotic place.
